# Nico The Robot
## ABSTRACT

Nico v1.0 is an AI powered Multi-purpose Modular Robot. Nico hardware is a minimal and affordable design. The MCU/MPU is designed to perform Critical Tasks. The main AI computation is performed at Cloud. Which makes it affordable and modular.

Nico can be used as a personal assistant, teacher, kids companion, Security guard and a lot more. It Works in a subscription manner. Customers pick subscriptions based on their interest.

Nico comprises a lot of Reliable sensors including mic,camera,thermal sensors,pressure,gyro, accelerometers ..etc. which can monitor the current status and assistance for a paralised or disabled man. They make sure Nico is provided with all the Necessary data which needs to be processed within the cloud.

The data is processed based on the Subscription.
